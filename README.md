# Imagelist DX8

This is a program I wrote in VB6, back in 2002, for my 3rd year Psychology project.  It was my first real experience of programming properly, I had only messed around with C and datastructures before this (excepting some basic programming and a bit of machine code way back in the 80s).

It allows you to specify a series of images that can be presented in a suitable order for a reaction time experiment, and then present them and record millisecond accurate response times using the directX 8.0 library.
I was particularly proud of the ux design and the use of sequence math to autogenerate experimental matrices.

The whole program took about two weeks of some sincerely sleepless nights, not through stress but through continuously working.  I had the bug.

Like all my code I present this under an MIT license.
